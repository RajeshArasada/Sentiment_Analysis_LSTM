# Bidirectional Character LSTM for Sentiment Analysis

## Predicting sentiment from product reviews
The goal of this project is to explore Sequence models and feature engineering with Tensorflow 2.0.

In this project, I will use product review data from Amazon.com to predict whether the sentiments about a product (from its reviews) are positive or negative. 
I will use tf.keras to do some feature engineering, build/train models with different architectures/layers: 
RNN, 1D CNN (multibranch), Bidirectional LSTM and 1D CNN - BiDirectional LSTM to predict the sentiment of product reviews. 
Make a prediction (both class and probability) of sentiment for a new product review. 
Compare the performance of multiple models.
